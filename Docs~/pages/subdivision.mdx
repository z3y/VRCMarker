# Distance Based Subdivision

The line renderer shader has access to all vertices so it was possible to subdivide it using Catmull-Rom. This provides smoother lines without doubling the cost of networking. Not available on Android. The default subdivision distance is set to \<3m from the camera position and is adjustable on the line renderer material. The subdivided mesh smoothly transitions from the regular mesh based on distance.
