# Desktop Utilities

Use the following keys to perform actions while holding a pen:

| Key                        | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tab (Held)                 | Draw with the mouse pointer                                                                                                   |
| Backspace                  | Undo                                                                                                                          |
| Del                        | Clear all lines                                                                                                               |
| Middle Mouse Button (Held) | This is a VRChat feature for all pickups that lets you rotate them by moving the mouse. Useful for flipping to use the eraser |

Drawing with the cursor currently is only accurate if the mouse acceleration is disabled, due to VRChat not providing a proper way to get the mouse position on the screen. Sensitivity also needs to be set to middle point and in game FoV set to default.
