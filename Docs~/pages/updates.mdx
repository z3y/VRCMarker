# Updates

## v3.1.3

- Added reticle to the write on surface mode
- Write on surface mode now disables when exiting the trigger while drawing too

## v3.1.2

- Created a workaround to fix known jittering issues with VRCPickups (while moving the pickup, rotating your head left and right in VR etc.)
- The Marker should now feel more constrained to the hand
- When enabled the pickup mesh position and rotation is manually set relative to the hand
- Applied in a way that should not break in the future if VRChat changes the pickup system
- IJKL, mouse scrolling and middle mouse button manipulations still work
