# Updates

## v3.3.1

- Use dominant sh direction for evaluating vrc light volumes

## v3.3.0

- VRC Light Volumes for the line renderer

## v3.2.5

- Added a [script](./reset.mdx) for globally resetting all markers

## v3.2.3

- Added a new empty line in the shader to fix a bug with the library folder

## v3.2.2

- Added proper bounds to the line renderer
- Bounds can be previewed in editor with gizmos

## v3.2.1

- Increased maximum number of points to 65536 (458752 triangles)
- Late join sync is still limited to 1/4 of that, since that's a pretty insane number of triangles
- This should allow for more flexibility, it increases the duration of constant drawing to 32 minutes before line segments start getting overwritten

## v3.2.0

- Slight update to the marker design
- Removed the need for custom shaders on the marker model itself in order to make replacing the model easier
- A new texture is generated per marker that indicates color or gradient and is assigned to a target property on materials
- This makes it possible to use the standard shader for example, with a mask and a UV2 detail map to tint markers to their color

## v3.1.3

- Added reticle to the write on surface mode
- Write on surface mode now disables when exiting the trigger while drawing too

## v3.1.2

- Created a workaround to fix known jittering issues with VRCPickups (while moving the pickup, rotating your head left and right in VR etc.)
- The Marker should now feel more constrained to the hand
- When enabled the pickup mesh position and rotation is manually set relative to the hand
- Applied in a way that should not break in the future if VRChat changes the pickup system
- IJKL, mouse scrolling and middle mouse button manipulations still work

## v3.1.1

- Smootly transition to the subdivided mesh instead of snapping
- Updated inspector

## v3.1.0

- Distance based subvidision on PC
- Disabed outlines on Quest for better performance
- Removed VRCX persistence

## v3.0.8b

- Increased max positions count by 4x (up to 16k positions).

## v3.0.7

- Reimplemented undo to be more reliable and efficient
- Fixed incorrect overwrite order after erasing

## v3.0.6

- Fixed a bug that would randomly cause 2 points to connect

## v3.0.5

- Added QoL Desktop features: Hold tab to draw with the cursor, Backspace to undo and Del to clear
- Keep in mind the cursor mode will not work under certain conditions (listed in features)

## v3.0.4

- Smoothing is no longer framerate dependent
- Fixed another small issue that can happen when the max line position count is reached

## v3.0.3

- Added emission setting and used vertex count indicator
- Added experimental vrcx persistence for instance owners (requires the manager prefab with all the markers dragged into the array, and a toggle on the marker itself)

## v3.0.2

- Fixed a bug when trying to undo when there is nothing to undo

## v3.0.1

- Fixed a bug with failed late join sync when the max line positions count is reached

## v3.0.0

- Initial release
